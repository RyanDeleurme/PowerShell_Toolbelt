# Site Connections
<p>This script is used for testing a site connection that requires a specific port number. Edit the ini file like this<br/><p/>

```ini
  [Connections]
  site_name = 443
  site_name2  = 8080
```

The ini file does not get more complicated than that. The output will show a grid view of the success and failures for <br/>
all the sites. Look inside the ini file for addional notes as well.
